# Gradient_descent
题目描述： 

1.Generate n = 2,000 points uniformly at random in the two-dimensional unit square.Which point do you expect the centroid to be?  
2.What objective does the centroid of the points optimize?  
3.Apply gradient descent to find the centroid.  
4.Apply stochastic gradient descent to find the centroid. Can you say in simple words,what the algorithm is doing?  
1、所谓质心，就是找到到所有点距离之和最小的点。由于点的生成都是随机的，所以期望的点是 : (0.5，0.5)。
